"You create a quasimancer—a loyal, undead minion with one or more spells that you imbue it with. You may cast this spell on an existing corporeal undead creature of CR 3 or lower, or on a corpse. The creature has the attributes and abilities of a wight.",
"In order to imbue the quasimancer with a spell, you must be able to cast that spell, must have the appropriate material components for it (if necessary), and must have additional components that cost 100 gp per level of the spell you are imbuing. It takes 1 minute per level of spell to imbue the quasimancer with a spell, in addition the spell’s normal casting time, and you may imbue a quasimancer with up to a number of spells of any level equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier. It can cast each spell once per day, unless you choose to imbue it with a single spell multiple times. The quasimancer has the Innate Spellcasting ability and uses Charisma as its spellcasting attribute.",
"The quasimancer is under your control for 1 month, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the quasimancer for another month, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current month ends. The use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four quasimancers you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one."

The objects in the room cannot be used as spell components.",

"oo Bathing Room. The room contains a large tub (you can make it large enough to fit 1-4 people); a fire pit to heat water; a mirror and dressing table; scented soaps and perfumes; combs, files, and scissors for nail, hair, and skin care; washcloths, loofahs, and towels; and a curtained-off area with a garderobe. If you create both this room and the bedroom, you can bring the clothes and supplies back and forth.",

This room contains up to six comfortable beds with sheets, duvets, and pillows, a small table next to each bed with a fully-stocked oil lamp; a storage chest at the end of each bed; and a chamber pot under each bed. If you create both this room and the bedroom, you can bring the clothes and supplies back and forth.",
"oo Dining Room. You create a dining table and comfortable chairs or benches that can sit up to 20 people. It will also create tablecloths, dishes and silverware, fingerbowls, table decorations, and if you wish, a name card at each place setting. If you create both this room and the kitchen adjacent to each other, you can bring the dishes and silverware back and forth.",
"oo Kitchen. You create up to five large tables; up to two complete sets of cooking utensils, pots, pans, bowls, measuring cups and spoons, and other such equipment; a sink with a water pump; a large stove; two fireplaces (one with a spit and one with a cauldron); and a box with a large brick of ice in it. It does not create food to be cooked. If you create both this room and the dining room adjacent to each other, you can bring the dishes and silverware back and forth.",
"oo Meeting Room. You create up to three conference tables and benches or chairs that can seat up to 20 people; parchment and ink; a common-quality map of the country, continent, or known world; lamps; and a dais with two chairs on it.",
"oo Temple. You create a lectern; an empty basin in which you may pour holy water; a sacrificial altar; pews to sit up to 20 people; up to 8 banners with religious imagery; a holy book (the most common variety); and a table with up to 20 prayer candles.",
"oo Throne Room. You create one, two, or three thrones on a dais; an equal number of crows and scepters; up to 20 banners that display your choice of motif; a narrow carpet that leads to the thrones; and tall candelabras loaded with dozens of candles.",
"oo Work Room. You create a room with 1-3 work benches and tool sets of your choice; parchment, ink, and charcoal for planning; and numerous lamps. You do not create the raw materials needed to use those tools, except for wood or coal for any forges or ovens. Items made with these tools can be removed from the room, but not the tools themselves.",
"At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with an 7th-level spell slot, the room may fit inside a 60-foot cube and the amount of beds, tables, chairs, etc., is doubled. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the room may fit inside a 120-foot cube and the amount of beds, tables, chairs, etc., is quadrupled. If you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot each day for a year, creating the same room and items each time, you can make this spell permanent. Objects still cannot be removed from the room or be used in combat or as spell components, but consumables will be replaced every 24 hours."

"You touch a Huge or smaller object while casting this spell and gain a psychic impression of one event or series of closely related events in that object’s history and that have a strong emotional component. This will not tell you if the object is magical but if it is, you will likely gain information that strongly suggests that it has been. The spell will also not reveal names unless the object belonged to a single person for a very long time, one of the objects had a very emotional reaction involving the object, or the object belonged to a very powerful or important person.",
"If you cast this spell on a very large object such as a building, you will only receive information about the area you touched.

In effect, you permanently gain advantage on one of Arcana, History, Religion, or Nature skill rolls when dealing with that one specific object."

"To cast this spell, you must first build a stone archway inscribed with arcane runes. The arch may be of any appearance and design of your choice. This archway does not have to be set up as part of a wall, although it can be. When you finish casting this spell, the door then permanently opens to an extradimensional space 40 feet wide × 60 feet long, with a 10 foot high ceiling. If you wish, you may alter its shape as long as it remains that size (the floor can take up no more than 2,400 square feet).

This increases the cost of the doorway by 100 gp, plus 100 gp per spell level, and increases the casting time by 1 hour, but causes those spells to be permanent. You are still bound by any limitations of those spells (you cannot remove items created by the create room",
