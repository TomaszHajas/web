"You create furniture, decorations, and supplies for a type of room of your choice. The objects you create will be arranged as if in a room that fits inside a 30-foot cube. You may determine the appearance of the objects you create. This spell does not create a floor, walls, ceiling, or door. If you cast the spell outdoors, the objects will appear on the ground. If you create the room indoors, the air will be maintained at a pleasant temperature; if cast outdoors, it has the ambient temperatures and weather conditions of the surrounding area. If you choose, the room can be stocked with up to 10 unseen servants. Any attempt to remove an object from the room or use an object in combat will cause that object to disappear. The objects in the room cannot be used as spell components.",
"The following is a list of rooms that can be created by this spell:",
"oo Bathing Room. The room contains a large tub (you can make it large enough to fit 1-4 people); a fire pit to heat water; a mirror and dressing table; scented soaps and perfumes; combs, files, and scissors for nail, hair, and skin care; washcloths, loofahs, and towels; and a curtained-off area with a garderobe. If you create both this room and the bedroom, you can bring the clothes and supplies back and forth.",
"oo Bedroom. This room contains up to six comfortable beds with sheets, duvets, and pillows, a small table next to each bed with a fully-stocked oil lamp; a storage chest at the end of each bed; and a chamber pot under each bed. If you create both this room and the bedroom, you can bring the clothes and supplies back and forth.",
"oo Dining Room. You create a dining table and comfortable chairs or benches that can sit up to 20 people. It will also create tablecloths, dishes and silverware, fingerbowls, table decorations, and if you wish, a name card at each place setting. If you create both this room and the kitchen adjacent to each other, you can bring the dishes and silverware back and forth.",
"oo Kitchen. You create up to five large tables; up to two complete sets of cooking utensils, pots, pans, bowls, measuring cups and spoons, and other such equipment; a sink with a water pump; a large stove; two fireplaces (one with a spit and one with a cauldron); and a box with a large brick of ice in it. It does not create food to be cooked. If you create both this room and the dining room adjacent to each other, you can bring the dishes and silverware back and forth.",
"oo Meeting Room. You create up to three conference tables and benches or chairs that can seat up to 20 people; parchment and ink; a common-quality map of the country, continent, or known world; lamps; and a dais with two chairs on it.",
"oo Temple. You create a lectern; an empty basin in which you may pour holy water; a sacrificial altar; pews to sit up to 20 people; up to 8 banners with religious imagery; a holy book (the most common variety); and a table with up to 20 prayer candles.",
"oo Throne Room. You create one, two, or three thrones on a dais; an equal number of crows and scepters; up to 20 banners that display your choice of motif; a narrow carpet that leads to the thrones; and tall candelabras loaded with dozens of candles.",
"oo Work Room. You create a room with 1-3 work benches and tool sets of your choice; parchment, ink, and charcoal for planning; and numerous lamps. You do not create the raw materials needed to use those tools, except for wood or coal for any forges or ovens. Items made with these tools can be removed from the room, but not the tools themselves.",
"At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with an 7th-level spell slot, the room may fit inside a 60-foot cube and the amount of beds, tables, chairs, etc., is doubled. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the room may fit inside a 120-foot cube and the amount of beds, tables, chairs, etc., is quadrupled. If you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot each day for a year, creating the same room and items each time, you can make this spell permanent. Objects still cannot be removed from the room or be used in combat or as spell components, but consumables will be replaced every 24 hours."

The creature is smoke-colored, with eyes like glowing coals, gleaming teeth and claws, and it exudes a stench of sulfur and old blood. Only the target is aware of the hound, and upon first seeing it, the target is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature drops whatever it is holding and must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.",
"As a phantasm, the hound can’t cause physical harm to the target or anything else; nor can it be harmed. However, the target will not be aware of it. In the target’s mind, the hound relentless stalks it, snarling, growling, and howling menacingly. It never comes closer to the target than 10 feet or stray farther than 300, but it never leaves and is can always be seen, heard, or smelled by the target; it even appears in all of the target’s dreams (which quickly turn to nightmares). The target is filled with unshakable premonitions of death (both its own death and the death of those around it).",
"While haunted by the hound, the target has disadvantage on all saving throws to resist being frightened, confused (such as by confusion or crown of madness), cursed, or to avoid taking psychic damage.",
"A remove curse will end this effect."

This increases the cost of the doorway by 100 gp, plus 100 gp per spell level, and increases the casting time by 1 hour, but causes those spells to be permanent.

It also seals the doorway shut for 24 hours. Likewise, you cannot connect two nilspaces directly together.",

If the creature had a higher or lower Strength or Dexterity than the recipient, then the recipient’s attributes with that limb increases or decreases by 1 point for every 4 full points difference between the donor and recipient. For instance, if a human with a Strength of 11 and Dexterity of 13 were to get an arm from an ogre with a Strength of 19 and Dexterity of 8, the human would have an effective Strength of 13 and Dexterity of 12 with that arm. If the limb is a leg from a creature with a walking speed of 15 feet or more higher or lower than the recipient’s, then the recipient’s walking speed increases or decreases by 5 feet.",

If the limb had an attack that caused the paralyzed or poisoned conditions, then it retains that ability. It does not retain any other special abilities (an arm taken from a red slaad, for instance, will not implant eggs). Likewise, the recipient does not gain any special abilities that the donor originally had.",

If the recipient and donor are of the same species or a closely-related species (such as a human and half-elf), then the recipient must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the recipient and donor are of the same creature type (such as humanoid) but otherwise very different species (such as human and kobold), the saving throw DC becomes 13. If the recipient and donor are of different creature types (such as human and ogre or wolf), the saving throw DC becomes 15. If",
"the recipient fails its saving throw, then the spell fails as well, the graft fails, and the recipient takes {@dice 3d10} necrotic damage.",
"oo Artificial Limb. If you use a prosthetic limb (typically made out of wood or metal), there is no chance of rejection and the limb’s Strength will be the same as the recipient’s. If the limb was built to be fully articulated, then its Dexterity will be the same as the recipient’s as well (a less well-designed limb will have a penalty to Dexterity—and a very well-designed, and likely much more expensive, limb may grant as much as a +2 bonus). In addition, the recipient will retain its full sense of touch with the limb. Finally, a prosthetic limb can be built with attachments, hidden compartments, and the like. The limb’s armor class depends on the material with which it was made."

There is no saving throw against this, unless the creature has magical protection against scrying; in that case, the creature may make a saving throw, but at disadvantage.

"oo Vulnerability. All creatures in the area suffer disadvantage on all saving throws. Any immunity the creature might have to a type of damage becomes a resistance instead, and resistances are nullified, for 1 minute.",

"You cause bad food to appear and taste wonderful. If the food is rotten or poisoned, then any damage the taint would normally inflict only occurs {@dice 2d4} hours later. Magical attempts to discern poisoning or spoilage using spells of 3rd level or lower will reveal nothing. If a spell is cast on the food to purify it, that spellcaster must make a spellcasting ability check, with a DC equal to your spell save DC, to successfully purify the food. Regardless of the outcome, that caster will believe it has succeeded.",
"The spell may also be cast on purely illusory food, making it appear in all respects to be a complete, filling, and real meal. A creature who eats the food will feel as if it has actually eaten and won’t be hungry again for the normal length of time. However, the eater has consumed no food. If the creature eats nothing but illusory food treated with this spell, it will begin to suffer the effects of starvation (as per the Player’s Handbook page 185). Thus, it is entirely possible to use this spell to make a creature think it is eating well while in reality it is starving to death."
