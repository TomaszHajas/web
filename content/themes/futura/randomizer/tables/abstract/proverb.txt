It is an ill wind that blows no one any good
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to be smarter than you appear than to appear smarter than you are
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It is better to cultivate a Land with two Bulls, rather working under Boss who never gives Wage when asked
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It is better to be a warrior in a garden than to be a gardener in a war
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is like juggling sand
It is never too late
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
It is not enough to learn how to ride, you must also learn how to fall
It is the early bird that gets the worm
It is the empty can that makes the most noise
It is the squeaky wheel that gets the grease
It is what it is
It needs a hundred lies to cover a single lie
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It takes a whole village to raise a child
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango

Milking the bull
Misery loves company
Moderation in all things
Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace, Wednesday's child is full of woe, Thursday's child has far to go, Friday's child is loving and giving, Saturday's child works hard for its living, and a child that is born on the Sabbath day is fair and wise and good and gay

Slow but sure
Softly, softly, catchee monkey
Some are more equal than others
Sometimes we are the student. Sometimes we are the master. And sometimes we are merely the lesson

Speak as you find
Speak softly and carry a big stick

Still waters run deep
Strike while the iron is hot
Stupid is as stupid does
Success has many fathers, while failure is an orphan
Speak of the devil and he will appear
