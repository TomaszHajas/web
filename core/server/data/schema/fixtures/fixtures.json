It's how I became an arbitrary game engine, processing their actions on a piece of paper passed between us, during one of many boring classes.

The first campaign, or rather - unplanned set of loosely and accidentally interconnected sessions - was set in some generic, nameless fantasy world, with no RPG system at all. The players there were my IRL friends from school. Then, I've GMed a new campaign a for a couple of years in play-by-forum style (short PBF), featuring my friends from video browser game. It was the time I learned more about tabletop RPGs in general and tried to create some roleplaying system with use of randomness provided by random.org service. I took a few years of break from GMing during my university (which was a true rat race and a time sponge). At this time I took part in couple of sessions GMed by my friends in systems like D&D4e and Neuroshima. Soon, when Roll20 came out and my studies got slower and steadier, I decided to give it a try and quickly ended up with GMing another campaign - this time I gave up on homebrew systems and decided to try out the mainstream, that is D&D5e. After two years-long campaigns I grew frustrated of the mind frames this system wants to pack the roleplay into. For the third Roll20 campaign I switched to Savage Worlds, which sounded like a simple, universal and modular system. For the fourth campaign, I chose to ascend (or descend?) even further into a minimalistic system called Freeform Universal, which supports narrative roleplay and improvisation. After encountering couple of problems with Roll20, I quickly discovered alternatives.

Another example of losing control would be players roleplaying without my knowledge. I have experienced it and it has the potential to ruin any element of session preparation a GM has in mind.

She composed many songs and poems centered around this idea, the lyrics and melody inspired by the ugly creatures. For as long as she’d been around, her artwork was usually adored and enjoyed by everyone, though she never cared about the popularity.

No family, no close friends, no loyal followers; no one is special to her.
